<div id=about-me><h1>About Me</h1><p>I ostensibly live in St Louis, Missouri, but I really just live on the Internet. You can find me in the following places:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/diablomarcus>Reddit</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katerberg>GitHub</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/diablomarcus>Twitter</a></li></ul><p>I am on most other sites as well. Look for me as <strong>/u/katerberg</strong> or <strong>/u/diablomarcus</strong>. Isn't it amazing how those usernames we chose when we were 12 years old have followed us around ever since?</p></div>
