    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I constantly am working on random projects but very few of them come to fruition. Here are a couple that seemed to have some promise:</p>
    <ul class="project-list">
        <li ng-click="goMinesweeper()">Minesweeper</li>
        <li ng-click="goSpellbook()">Pathfinder Spellbook</li>
    </ul>
</div>
