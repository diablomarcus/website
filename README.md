# Website

A static personal site to show off some of my work and to keep from forgetting too much

# Requirements
You will need `npm` and `bower` installed.

# Starting

Run the following to build the files in `./app` into their release version which lives in `./dist`. This will watch the development files and automatically rebuild the `./dist` folder when needed.
```
gulp
```

To actually serve the files to view them in the browser, run the following:

```
npm serve
```

To combine the two previous commands concurrently (to watch and serve the files), run the following:

```
npm start
```

# Releasing

The application is hosted on [github](http://github.com).
